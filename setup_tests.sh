echo "📋 To complete the test setup:"
echo "1. Open Xcode: open AIChatBot.xcodeproj"
echo "2. In Xcode, go to File → New → Target..."
echo "3. Choose 'Unit Testing Bundle' under 'Test'"
echo "4. Name it 'AIChatBotTests'"
echo "5. Make sure the target to be tested is 'AIChatBot'"
echo "6. Click 'Finish'"
echo "7. When prompted, delete the default test file Xcode creates"
echo "8. Right-click on AIChatBotTests group in the navigator"
echo "9. Choose 'Add Files to AIChatBotTests...'"
echo "10. Select all .swift files from the AIChatBotTests folder"
echo "11. Make sure they're added to the AIChatBotTests target"

echo "🏃‍♂️ Alternative: Run tests with Swift directly"
echo "You can also run individual test files with:"
echo "swift test # (if converted to Swift Package)"

echo "📚 Test Coverage Summary:"
echo "========================="
echo "✅ AIServiceTests.swift - Tests AI functionality, providers, chat history"
echo "✅ ConfigTests.swift - Tests configuration and settings persistence"
echo "✅ CarPlayManagerTests.swift - Tests CarPlay integration"
echo "✅ VoiceManagerTests.swift - Tests voice recognition and speech"
echo "✅ KeychainManagerTests.swift - Tests secure API key storage"
echo "✅ IntegrationTests.swift - Tests component integration"

echo ""
echo "🎯 Key Testing Areas Covered:"
echo "• AI response formatting and citation removal"
echo "• Customizable sentence count settings"
echo "• CarPlay scene management and templates"
echo "• Voice command processing"
echo "• Keychain security and persistence"
echo "• Cross-component integration"
echo "• Error handling and edge cases"
echo "• Performance testing"

echo ""
echo "🚀 Once setup is complete, run tests with:"
echo "   Cmd+U in Xcode"
echo "   or: xcodebuild test -scheme AIChatBot -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16'"
